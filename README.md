# Ekron
Ekron is a simple Music Bot made for Discord using javascript

# Purpose
It's always good to host your own Music bot because bots like Rythm don't always perform that well under high load and also they lock some features like volume control for only the paying members. (Can be hosted on heroku , will soon make a video about it.)

# Commands
`!play (url or search)`,
`!skip`,
`!pause `,
`!resume `,
`!np `,
`!volume (number to set, if not provided , tells the current volume)`,
`!ping`,
More comming soon

# Installtion 
**Nodejs is required for the bot to work, install it before proceeding further**
1. Edit config.json and put the token of the bot and also the prefix, default prefix for the bot is '!'.
2. Now cd to the root directory of the bot and do `npm install`
3. After all the modules finish installing , do `node main.js` to start the bot.

## Optional Info
You can use a module like `forever` to make the bot restart itself if it crashes somehow.
